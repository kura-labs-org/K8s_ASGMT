# Kubernetes Assignment

# Task 1: Using Docker to run a Python Flask Application

1. When running an application, its best to make a new directory or a new folder to store all of your application files in an organized place separated from other computer files. As shown below, I made a new folder called "project" on my Desktop to store all of my application files in a one place.

<html>
     <h1>
        <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/12.png width="1000" />
     </h1>
</html>  

<html>
   <h1>
      <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/13.png width="1000" />
   </h1>
</html>

2. After knowing where your files are located in your system, open the Command Prompt or Terminal. Now open use the cd command to enter into the directory. As shown above I have two files called "Dockerfile" and requirements.txt. To run an application on Docker, these two files are needed. <br>
<br>
3. To make a requirements.txt, enter the commands on your computer or virtual environment to run the application:

```
py -m pip list (Windows)
python -m pip list (Unix/MacOS)
```

This shows what packages will be needed to be installed to run your application. Copy the list of packages and paste it
into a new file called 'requirements.txt'.  <br>
<br>
To make a new file by using the command line in the same directory where the application files are located, enter
the command "nano requirements.txt" and a blank screen should show up. It is also possible to paste and then save 
the list package information by using this method too. Below shows my package list to run my application:

<html>
   <h1>
      <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/15.png width="1000" />
   </h1>
</html>


By listing the needed packages, the Dockerfile can be told to read the package information and download it to make 
an image to run the application. <br>
<br>
*The naming of 'requirements.txt' is case sensitive and should be written as shown in quotes. <br>
 <br>
4. To create a Dockerfile in the same directory where the application files are located, enter the following:
```
FROM python:3.10
COPY ./requirements.txt requirements.txt
COPY templates/ /templates/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY application.py application.py
ENV FLASK_APP=application.py
EXPOSE 5000
CMD flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```
From the command line in the same application files directory, you can also run 'nano Dockerfile' and paste the following 
information above and it should look like as shown below if the terminal was used to make the Dockerfile. 

<html>
   <h1>
      <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/14.png width="1000" />
   </h1>
</html>

<html>
   <h1>
      <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/2.png width="1000" />
   </h1>
</html>


5. Now use Dockerfile to build an image with the command:
```
"docker build -t ------" 
```
----- is the name that can be given to the newly created image. I named my image fproject1.1 <br>
If an error was received from the command above, make sure Docker is installed and currently running on the computer <br>
<br>
6. Now run the command: 
```
"docker run -d -p 5000:5000 ------" 
```

A string of many letters and numbers should appear indicating a new container was created but now to see the application on the terminal, type the next command:
```   
"curl localhost:5000"
```

<html>
   <h1>
      <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/3.png width="1000" />
   </h1>
</html>

<html>
   <h1>
      <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/4.png width="1000" />
   </h1>
</html>

<html>
   <h1>
      <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/5.png width="1000" />
   </h1>
</html>


On a web browser, type localhost:5000 and the application should appear

<html>
   <h1>
      <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/9.png width="1000" />
   </h1>
</html>


# Task 2: Pushing a Docker image to Dockerhub to run it on Kubernetes

1. By creating a Dockerfile and using the build command, an image is made and accesible through our local computer. To access the same image from anywhere, Docker has their own GUI called Dockerhub. Its possible to send images from a local computer by using the push command to send the image to a Dockerhub account. From the terminal log in to your docker account with the command:
```
docker login
```   
It asks for your username and password to your Dockerhub account. <br>
<br>   
Then run the command:
```   
docker push username/imagename
```
username - Name of Dockerhub account. Found on top right of the screen. <br>
imagename - The name of the image

2. To run a Kubernetes cluster, run the command:
```
"k3d cluster create -p "8081:8080@loadbalancer"
```   
This specific commands makes a Kubernetes cluster and each cluster needs a port to be specified. The first number (8081) shows the number that other devices can connect to it while 8080 is the port of the cluster.

3. A message should appear the application is running however, run the command:
```
"kubectl get pod"
```   
kubectl get pod shows if the application is currently running. If the status shows "RUNNING", then the application is running. <br>
<br>   
To access the application on an internet browser, we must create a yaml file. <br>
<br>
4. To make a yaml file, type the command:
```
"nano ----.yaml"
```
----: The name you choose for the file <br>
<br>   
Refer to the code below to make the yaml file. Update the following lines:
```
app:"" with the name of the image
name: Anything for your reference
image: username/image
containerPort: 5000

port: 8080
targetPort: 5000
```

<html>
   <h1>
      <img style="float: center;" src=Pictures/16.png width="1000" />
   </h1>
</html>

On the internet browser, type in localhost:8081 to access the application.
